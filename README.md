I’ve successfully built a fully functional REST API CRUD project using Node.js and Express, with a robust PostgreSQL database setup — all containerized using Docker for a seamless development and deployment experience.

I covered every essential step, from configuring the Docker environment and spinning up the PostgreSQL container to designing clean and efficient API routes for Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. I implemented centralized error handling, created a standardized response structure for the APIs, and integrated Joi for schema validation to ensure clean and reliable data.

The result is a performant, scalable, and easy-to-maintain backend API that’s ready for real-world applications. This project has been a great addition to my portfolio and has strengthened my backend development skills, especially for full-stack or production-grade environments.
